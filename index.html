  <h3>About UnityPass</h3>
  <p>
    UnityPass is a digital identification and empowerment initiative designed 
    to help unskilled and semi-skilled workers showcase their abilities through 
    a verified online skill ID. It enables individuals to register their skills, 
    generate a QR-based digital card, and share it with potential employers, 
    helping bridge the gap between opportunity and talent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyone can use UnityPass to store their professional details securely and 
    present them digitally — promoting transparency, recognition, and easy access 
    to job and training opportunities.
